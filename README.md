# Broke or Broker?
***
### Info
Cindy uses the services of a brokerage firm to buy and sell stocks.
The firm charges 1.5% service charges on the total amount for each
transaction, buy or sell. When Cindy sells stocks, she would like to
know if she gained or lost on a particular investment. Write a program
that allows Cindy to input the number of shares sold, the purchase price
of each share, and the selling price of each share. The program outputs
the amount invested, the total service charges, amount gained or lost,
and the amount received after selling the stock.
### Example
```c++
"How many shares did you sell?" 20 shares
"What was your cost per share purchase?" $12.32 per share
"What was your cost per share on sale?" $15 per share
```
```c++
"You invested:" $246.40
"You were charged a total of" $8.196 "in service fees."
"You managed a net gain of" $45.404
```
#### Input
+ Shares Sold -> double
+ Price per Share on Purchase -> float
+ Price per Share on Sale -> float

#### Output
+ Total Investment -> double
+ Service Fee -> float
+ Net Return -> double
