### Info
Analyze and design the algorithm (including the pseudocode algorithm) for the problem below. Write the program and turn in the analysis, design, and source code.

Let l be a line in the x-y plane. If l is a vertical line, its equation is x = a for some real number a. Suppose l is not a vertical line and its slope is m. Then the equation of l is y = mx + b, where b is the y-intercept. If l passes through the point (x0, y0,), the equation of l can be written as y – y0 = m(x – x0). If (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are two points in the x-y plane and x1 ≠ x2, the slope of the line passing through these points is m = (y2 – y1) / (x2 – x1). Write a program that prompts the user to enter two points in the x-y plane. The program  outputs  the  equation  of  the  line  and  uses  if  statements  to determine and output whether the line is vertical, horizontal, increasing, or decreasing. If l is a nonvertical line, output its equation in the form y = mx + b.
