##Author: Rickey Barnes
 
###Info
A milk carton can hold 3.78 liters of milk. Each morning, a dairy
farm ships cartons of milk to a local grocery store. Each carton can
hold 3.78 liters of milk. Write a program that allows the user to
enter the cost of producing one liter of milk, the profit on each
carton of milk, and the total amount of milk produced that day.
The program then calculates and displays the number of milk cartons
needed to hold the milk, the cost of producing the milk and the
profit for that day.

###Example
```c++
"How much does it cost to produce one liter of milk?" $0.59
"What are your profits on a carton of milk?" $3.29
"What was your total milk production for the day?" 131 Liters
```


####Input
+ Cost per Liter -> Float
+ Profits per Carton -> Float
+ Liters Produced -> Float

####Output
+ Cartons Needed -> Integer
+ Production Costs -> Float
+ Profits -> Float



The total amount of cartons you would need is: l
Your production cost for the day would be: $
Your total profits for the day would be: $
