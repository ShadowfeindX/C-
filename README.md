# Milk Man
***
### Info
A milk carton can hold 3.78 liters of milk. Each morning, a dairy
farm ships cartons of milk to a local grocery store. Each carton can
hold 3.78 liters of milk. Write a program that allows the user to
enter the cost of producing one liter of milk, the profit on each
carton of milk, and the total amount of milk produced that day.
The program then calculates and displays the number of milk cartons
needed to hold the milk, the cost of producing the milk and the
profit for that day.
### Example
```c++
"What is your production cost per liter?" $0.59
"What are your profits on a carton of milk?" $3.29
"What was your total milk production?" 131 Liters
```
```c++
"You would need a total of:" 35 Cartons
"Your production cost for the day would be:" $77.29
"Your total profits for the day would be:" $37.86
```
#### Input
+ Cost per Liter -> Float
+ Profits per Carton -> Float
+ Liters Produced -> Float
#### Output
+ Cartons Needed -> Integer
+ Production Costs -> Float
+ Profits -> Float
