# Special Pay
***
### Info
Three employees in a company are up for a special pay increase. You are
given a file, say SalaryData.txt, with the following data:
```
Miller Andrew 65789.87 5
Green Sheila 75892.56 6
Sethi Amit 74900.50 6.1
```
Each input line consists of an employeeâ€™s last name, first name,
current salary, and percent pay increase. For example, in the first
input line, the last name of the employee is Miller, the first name is
Andrew, the current salary is 65789.87, and the pay increase is 5%.
Write a program that reads data from the specified file and stores the
output in the file SalaryOutput.dat. For each employee, the data  must 
be output in the following form: firstName lastName updatedSalary.
Format the output of decimal numbers to two decimal places

### Implementation

```
new_salary = salary X increase;
```
