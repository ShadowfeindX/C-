# Title
***
### Info
Write a program that mimics a calculator. The program should take as input two integers and the operation
to be performed. It should then output the numbers, the operator, and the result. (For division, if the
denominator is zero, output an appropriate message.) Some sample outputs follow:

`3 + 4 = 7`

`13  * 5 = 65`

Turn in two versions, the first version uses if..else statements, the second version uses a switch statement.

### Implementation
> These are the constants and functions used to calculate the program output.

```

```

## Input
***
> The following user data is needed to calculate the program output.

+ 

#### Example
```c++

```

## Output
***
> The following system data is output by the program.

+ 

### Example
```c++

```
