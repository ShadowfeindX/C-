# Broke or Broker?
***
### Info
Cindy uses the services of a brokerage firm to buy and sell stocks.
The firm charges 1.5% service charges on the total amount for each
transaction, buy or sell. When Cindy sells stocks, she would like to
know if she gained or lost on a particular investment. Write a program
that allows Cindy to input the number of shares sold, the purchase price
of each share, and the selling price of each share. The program outputs
the amount invested, the total service charges, amount gained or lost,
and the amount received after selling the stock.

### Implementation
> These are the constants and functions used to calculate the program output.

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
SERVICE_FEE = .015

investment -> shares_sold X cost_per_share

profits -> shares_sold X value_per_share

service_charge -> (investment + profits) X SERVICE_FEE

net_return -> profits - investment - service_charge

>> values are rounded to 3 decimal places
>> to allow for better precision
