# Growing Population
***
### Info
The  population  of  a  town  A  is  less  than  the  population  of  town  B.
However, the population of town A is growing faster than the population of town B.
Write a program that prompts the user to enter the population and growth rate of
each town. The program outputs after how many years the population of town A will
be greater than or equal to the population of town B and the populations of both
the towns at that time.

(A sample input is: Population of town A = 5000, growth rate of town A = 4%,
population of town B = 8000, and growth rate of town B = 2%.)

### Implementation
> These are the constants and functions used to calculate the program output.
